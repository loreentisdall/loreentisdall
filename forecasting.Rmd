## Course summary
<p style="text-align:justify;">The future is uncertain, yet we strive to predict what may happen hours, days, weeks, months or even years in advance. What team will win the Swiss Football League? Will the James Webb Space Telescope launch on time? Will there be another lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic? All too often we imagine ourselves as expert forecasters, and opine to know what will happen in the future. But, despite the lure of the superforecasters, making good forecasts is equally fascinating as it is difficult. What information _should_ a good forecast be based on, versus what _are_ many forecasts actually based on? How _should_ information be integrated versus how _is_ information integrated? What actually _is_ a good forecast, how can we judge its performance? WHo is the better forecaster: Man or machine? In this seminar we cover the basic principles and psychology of (successful) prediction and examine how well various prediction techniques work under different conditions.</p>

## Aim of the course
<p style="text-align:justify;">Students taking this course will acquire an overview of different forecasting techniques, including _judgmental_ and _statistical methods_, as well as hybrid forms. Weekly sessions will enable students to critically assess the pros, cons and required conditions of different methods, and to quantify their performance. Based on _weekly programming exercises_ in R, students will also learn to apply the theoretical insights and compute, assess and improve their own forecasts.</p>

## Prerequisites
<p style="text-align:justify;">Basic programming skills in R (Studio) are essential for some of the weekly exercises. To practice and further develop your R skills, we will identify individually relevant opportunities for asynchronous learning, including online R tutorials and literature recommendations. </p>
