Some of my work asks whether, how and why risk-related decisions change across the life span, to what extent different measures of risk and impulsivity converge, and the extent to which studying brain function and anatomy can help us understand the biological basis of individual differences.\n\n\nTo address the various questions motivating my work, I adopt a variety of research methods to collect data, including behavioral experiments, surveys and neuroimaging studies, and I use a variety of data analysis techniques to derive statistical inferences from the sampled data to the wider population of interest. In the future, I hope to transfer some of these methods and the insights gained from studying decisions under risk to a new application context that is close to my heart and part of my previous training, which is the area of decision making in legal settings, including aspects of delinquency and policing.\n\nPositions\n05/2020-present: Postdoctoral research assistant, Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences, University of Basel, Switzerland\n11/2019-04/2021: Postdoctoral research fellow, spanlab, Stanford University, CA, USA\n07/2018-09/2019: Postdoctoral research assistant, Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences, University of Basel, Switzerland\nEducation\n09/2014-06/2018: PhD Psychology, Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences, University of Basel, Switzerland\n10/2012-09/2014: MSc Social, Cognitive, and Affective Neuroscience, Free University Berlin, Berlin, Germany\n09/2011-11/2012: MRes Security Science, University College London, UK\n10/2008-11/2009: MSc Crime Science, University College London, UK\n10/2005-08/2008: BSc(Hons) Psychology, Goldsmiths’ College, University of London, UK\nGrants and awards\nEarly Postdoc.Mobility grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation\nPostdoctoral grant from the University of Basel Research Fund for Excellent Junior Researchers\nPenny Willow Prize for best MSc dissertation in Crime Science in 2009, Jill Dando Institute for Crime Science, University College London\nPeer review activities\nI have written reviews for several journals, including Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology, Frontiers in Psychology, International Journal of Behavioral Development, Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, Journal of Cognitive Psychology, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, Journal of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences, Psychological Science, Psychology and Aging, Scientific Reports, Value in Health.

What team will win the Swiss Football League? What party or candidate will clinch the next election? When will the next scientific breakthrough discovery be made, and who wil make it? All too often we imagine ourselves as expert forecasters, and opine to know what will happen in the future. But, despite the lure of the superforecasters, making good forecasts is equally fascinating as it is difficult. What information should a good forecast be based on, versus what are many forecasts actually based on? How should information be integrated versus how is information integrated? What actually is a good forecast, how can we judge its performance? Who is the better forecaster: Man or machine? In this seminar we cover the basic principles and psychology of (successful) prediction and examine how well various prediction techniques work under different conditions.\n\nAim of the course\n\nStudents taking this course will acquire an overview of different forecasting techniques, including judgmental and statistical methods, as well as hybrid forms. Weekly sessions will enable students to critically assess the pros, cons and required conditions of different methods, and to quantify their performance. Based on weekly (programming) exercises students will also learn to apply the theoretical insights and compute, assess and improve their own forecasts.\n\nBackground literature\nArmstrong, J. S.

      "contents": "\nCourse summary\n\nThe idea that some people are born negotiators who employ the art of negotiation to achieve maximally beneficial results for their own purpose is a pervasive one, yet it is scientifically questionable. Instead, there may be much more of a science of negotiation, which can help individuals to prepare for, engage in, and close negotiations, and to do so more successfully. Negotiations are complex, of course, with outcomes ranging from getting the purchase price down on a new bike, to deciding the future of company employees during a takeover, or ending a hostage situation peacefully and without injury. By examining negotiations scientifically, we can establish basic principles that hold across different negotiation situations, which in turn allow us to identify factors that influence negotiation processes and outcomes.\n\nAim of the course\n\nStudents taking this course will learn the fundamental principles and concepts underlying negotiation theory and behavioral decision making. Based on concrete role-playing exercises featuring predefined goals, budgets, etc., students will develop and continually improve their negotiation skills, including how to frame, prepare, and conduct different kinds of negotiations.\n\nBackground literature\nRaiffa, H.

Key collaborators are Kelly MacNiven, Brian Knutson and Rui Mata.\n\n\nDiffRisk (2021-2022)\n\nPrevious work suggested that neural functional activity in the nucleus accumbens to risk- and reward-related cues can predict real-life risk-taking behavior. Given that nucleus accumbens functional activity is driven by neurotransmission from connected brain regions, in this project we are investigating whether the structural properties of tracts carrying signals to the nucleus accumbens may also predict risk preference. Key collaborators are Rui Mata, Renato Frey, Kelly MacNiven, and Brian Knutson.\n\n\nAgeRisk 2.0 (2016-2022)\n\nIn this project we are investigating the effect of age on individual differences in risk preference and related constructs (impulsivity and self-control) in a healthy human life span sample. A particular focus of this project is to examine the extent to which associations between age and the different constructs differ as a function of whether we use self reports, behavioral measures, informant reports, or neuroimaging to assess risk preference, impulsivity, or self-control. Key collaborators are Rui Mata, Renato Frey, Dirk Wulff, and David Kellen.\n\n\nDiffRelapse (2020-2022)\n\nI started this exciting new area of research during my time as a postdoctoral researcher at spanlab (Stanford University). In this particular project we investigated whether the structural properties of white-matter projections converging on the nucleus accumbens predict relapse to stimulant use in human stimulant use disorder patients. Key collaborators are Kelly MacNiven, Brian Knutson, Josiah Leong, and Claudia Padula. Our manuscript is currently under review.\n\n\nCompleted\nBasel-Berlin Risk Study (Neuroimaging component) (2014-2020)\n\nIn this project we used functional neuroimaging to investigate whether risk-taking related brain activation in two popular behavioral risk-taking measures converge at the level of the group and the individual. We also investigated whether individual differences in risk-taking related brain activity can predict actual risk-taking behavior. Here is the link to our paper.\n\n\nNeuroimaging Analysis Replication and Prediction Study (narps) (2018-2020)\n\nThe narps project was a many-analysts study with the goal to estimate the variability of neuroscientific results coming from data collected using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Laura Fontanesi and I contributed to this study as one of the many analysis teams. Here is the link to the paper.\n\n\nAgeRisk 1.0 (2015-2016)\n\nIn this project we investigated the convergent validity of different self-report and behavioral assessments of risk taking in a comprehensive life span sample. We also investigated whether the age-related patterns we observed for self-reported risk-taking in our study sample were representative of patterns reported for large-sale, population-based surveys. Here is the link to our paper.\n\n\n",
