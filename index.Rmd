I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences at the University of Basel in Switzerland. As a research psychologist in the area of decision science, I study how and why humans differ in their choices compared to others. I have a special interest in risk- and impulsivity related decisions, which we encounter in both day-to-day contexts but which also play a crucial role in clinical and legal contexts.</p>
